# Codigo-youtube
Code to download youtube videos with graphical interface
This code is not in the latest version, it needs some adjustments.
The purpose of this code was to recreate a kind of snaptube and not have to go through a screen similar to that of the +18 sites every time I went to download a song
The code uses a mix of libraries... Using PySimpleGUI (for interface), Pytube (to grab/download the video) and OS (to download mp3 files only)
First code that I dedicate myself to create and I was very happy with the result so far. It's a simple code and probably full of flaws, but I couldn't fail to record my first "great" done as a young programmer. S2
